# syntenyPlotteR-file-preparation
Here is a python script that takes a [mummer](https://mummer.sourceforge.net/) (nucmer) alignment output and transfers it into a form suitable for the package [syntenyPlotteR](https://github.com/Farre-lab/syntenyPlotteR) in R.

### Requirements: glob, numpy, pandas

_Note: I suggest using a python IDE such as [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) which has these preinstalled/preloaded if you can't load them._
